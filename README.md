we collected the speed data for each time frame, totaling 423 frames, which included both forward (positive values) and reverse speeds (negative values).
We first eliminated worms with a negative average speed and those with less than 100 recorded frames!
removed any columns with more than 3 consecutive negative blocks and checked if the remaining columns had more than 100 frames
